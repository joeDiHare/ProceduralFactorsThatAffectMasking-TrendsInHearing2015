Code for the Trends in Hearing article 2016

The concept: 
  { The format for scientific publishic is broken.
    Forced to follow templates, to use of archaic language and to be correct before useful. 
    Including code and data is often seen as a vulnerability and not a strength. There's got to be a better way of doing things. 
    I am making an effor to publish the code and the data (when [legally] possible) from my publications in the hope this can be of use to others.
    "Show me the code and the data or it didn't happen."

Here is the code [MATLAB] used to measure thresholds  in forward and simultaneous masking paradigms described in:
